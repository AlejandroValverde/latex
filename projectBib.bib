It presents substantiated techniques for use (1) early in the design or concept study phase, (2) to evaluate changes resulting from proposed engineering fixes, and (3) as a training on cross-training aid. It bridges the gap between theory and practice by including a combination of pertinent discussion and proven practical methods. For any given configuration and flight condition, and complete set of stability and control derivatives can be determined without resort to outside information. A spectrum of methods is presented, ranging from very simple and easily applied techniques to quite accurate and thorough procedures. Comparatively simple methods are presented in complete form, while the more complex methods are often handled by reference to separate treatments. Tables which compare calculated results with test data provide indications of method accuracy. Extensive references to related material are also included.},

  abstract = {Large loads caused by fluid-structure interaction leading to fatigue failure and added robustness of wing-like structures constitute important design challenges to be addressed. A reduction in the penalties associated to the added structural mass required to withstand rare load scenarios by means of load alleviation control is highly desirable, particularly for efficient light-weight engineering systems, such as aircraft and wind turbine blades. Implementation of morphing for modifying the lift distribution to mitigate the impact of rare, but integrity threatening, loads on wing-like structures offers a potential solution for such challenges. In this paper, a passive load alleviation aerofoil concept featuring variable stiffness multi-stable elements is presented. The adaptability in the structural response of the aerofoil when subjected to aerodynamic forces allows for passively changing from a high lift generation shape, to a load alleviation configuration exploiting the energy of the flow. Passive implementations to achieve load alleviation through morphing result in lighter and simpler designs in comparison to actively actuated solutions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {An investigation into the aeroelastic characteristics of a wind tunnel model all-movable vertical tail with variable attachment position and stiffness has been made. An initial analytical study investigated the effect of varying the torsional stiffness and position of the single root attachment. An attachment was designed and manufactured that enabled an existing wind tunnel model to behave as an all-moving fin in order to validate the analytical results. This initial study showed that in order to get the full benefits of such a design, whilst still meeting aeroelastic constraints, the torsional stiffness must be adaptive so that it can be adjusted at different regions of the flight envelope. A further variable stiffness attachment was then designed and manufactured that enabled fully adaptive torsional stiffness control. Bench-top tests were performed to validate the structural behaviour of the models, followed by wind tunnel tests to examine the aeroelastic characteristics of the vertical tail models, in particular the aeroelastic effectiveness. The experimental results compared well with theoretical predictions. It was shown that it is possible to control the torsional stiffness, and hence the aeroelastic characteristics, of the all-moving vertical tail using the adaptive stiffness device.

Such a wing is not amenable to conventional aileron mechanisms for roll control, due to a lack of internal wing structure. Therefore, morphing (in the form of asymmetric twisting) is implemented through the use of a torque-actuated wing structure with thousands of discrete design permutations. A static aeroelastic model of the micro air vehicle is developed and validated to optimize the performance of the torque-actuated wing structure. Objective functions include the steady-state roll rate and the lift-to-drag ratio incurred during such a maneuver. An optimized design is obtained through the use of a genetic algorithm presenting significant improvements in both performance metrics compared with the baseline design.},

  abstract = {A multifunctional panel concept is presented in which a lightweight, structurally efficient sandwich panel is able to undergo a reversible change in shape upon application of a localized thermal stimulus while supporting significant load. The shape change is effected by shape memory alloy face sheet elements, which exploit a "one-way" shape memory effect only. Unlike other related designs, no external or bias forces are required to complete the full cycle of shape change. The reversible shape change is accomplished by a core design which forces an inactive face sheet to martensitically deform in tension when the opposing face sheet undergoes a length change. By alternately heating one face sheet and then the other, the sandwich panel is able to perform fully reversible cyclic shape changes. The performance of the sandwich panel, in terms of required thermal power, actuation frequency, peak load bearing capacity, stiffness, and weight, can be optimized by proper selection of face sheet material and its thickness, the overall core thickness, core member thickness and length, and the design of the joint connecting core members and face sheet. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Aircraft wings are a compromise that allows the aircraft to fly at$\backslash$na range of flight conditions, but the performance at each condition$\backslash$nis sub-optimal. The ability of a wing surface to change its geometry$\backslash$nduring flight has interested researchers and designers over the years$\backslash$nas this reduces the design compromises required. Morphing is the$\backslash$nshort form for metamorphose; however, there is neither an exact definition$\backslash$nnor an agreement between the researchers about the type or the extent$\backslash$nof the geometrical changes necessary to qualify an aircraft for the$\backslash$ntitle {\^{a}}€˜shape morphing.{\^{a}}€™ Geometrical parameters that can be affected$\backslash$nby morphing solutions can be categorized into: planform alteration$\backslash$n(span, sweep, and chord), out-of-plane transformation (twist, dihedral/gull,$\backslash$nand span-wise bending), and airfoil adjustment (camber and thickness).$\backslash$nChanging the wing shape or geometry is not new. Historically, morphing$\backslash$nsolutions always led to penalties in terms of cost, complexity, or$\backslash$nweight, although in certain circumstances, these were overcome by$\backslash$nsystem-level benefits. The current trend for highly efficient and$\backslash$n{\^{a}}€˜green{\^{a}}€™ aircraft makes such compromises less acceptable, calling$\backslash$nfor innovative morphing designs able to provide more benefits and$\backslash$nfewer drawbacks. Recent developments in {\^{a}}€˜smart{\^{a}}€™ materials may$\backslash$novercome the limitations and enhance the benefits from existing design$\backslash$nsolutions. The challenge is to design a structure that is capable$\backslash$nof withstanding the prescribed loads, but is also able to change$\backslash$nits shape: ideally, there should be no distinction between the structure$\backslash$nand the actuation system. The blending of morphing and smart structures$\backslash$nin an integrated approach requires multi-disciplinary thinking from$\backslash$nthe early development, which significantly increases the overall$\backslash$ncomplexity, even at the preliminary design stage. Morphing is a promising$\backslash$nenabling technology for the future, next-generation aircraft. However,$\backslash$nmanufacturers and end users are still too skeptical of the benefits$\backslash$nto adopt morphing in the near future. Many developed concepts have$\backslash$na technology readiness level that is still very low. The recent explosive$\backslash$ngrowth of satellite services means that UAVs are the technology of$\backslash$nchoice for many investigations on wing morphing. This article presents$\backslash$na review of the state-of-the-art on morphing aircraft and focuses$\backslash$non structural, shape-changing morphing concepts for both fixed and$\backslash$nrotary wings, with particular reference to active systems. Inflatable$\backslash$nsolutions have been not considered, and skin issues and challenges$\backslash$nare not discussed in detail. Although many interesting concepts have$\backslash$nbeen synthesized, few have progressed to wing tunnel testing, and$\backslash$neven fewer have flown. Furthermore, any successful wing morphing$\backslash$nsystem must overcome the weight penalty due to the additional actuation$\backslash$nsystems.},

In contrast with classical centresym-metric cellular structures like rectangular or hexagonal grids, the proposed honeycomb did not present inversion symmetry, and featured an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio behaviour. The cellular structure considered exhibited this Poisson's ratio behaviour under a large range of strain. A set of numerical (finite element, FE) simulations have been carried out in order to correct the initial theoretical predictions to take into account axial, shear and elastic deformations of all elements composing the unit cell when subjected to uniaxial loading. The homogenized linear elastic mechanical properties were then introduced in an FE wing box model of a racecar wing coupled to a panel code to simulate unidirectional static fluid--structure coupling between the wing box and the flow surrounding the airfoil. The cellular solid proposed as the internal layout of the wing box allowed conforming deformations with the external flow, giving a variation of the camber line and trailing edge displacement, and acting as an aileron},

Several structural models are examined. The non-affine kinematics are seen to be essential for the production of negative Poisson's ratios for isotropic materials containing central force linkages of positive stiffness. Non-central forces combined with pre-load can also give rise to a negative Poisson's ratio in isotropic materials. A chiral microstructure with non- central force interaction or non-affine deformation can also exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Toughness and damage resistance in these materials may be affected by the Poisson's ratio itself, as well as by generalized continuum aspects associated with the microstructure.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an innovative wing profile featuring an internal truss-like structure of chiral topology. The chiral design is selected because of its unique deformation characteristics, which produce a theoretical, in-plane Poisson's ratio of -1. Such a Poisson's ratio yields a very high shear modulus, which in principle does not require the wing profile to be defined by a closed section or stressed-skin configuration. In addition, the peculiar deformation mechanism of the chiral configuration allows large decambering deflections to occur, with all the members of assembly behaving within the linear range of the material. Hence the proposed design combines large chordwise compliance and large in-plane shear stiffness. Such conflicting mechanical properties can be achieved through the proper selection of a limited number of geometric parameters defining the core configuration. The objective of the paper is to investigate the compliance characteristics of the airfoil. Two-dimensional profiles, designed according to results from previous investigations, are manufactured and tested to assess compliance and evaluate decambering deflection limits. The experimental analysis is guided by numerical models that account for deviations from the ideal configuration due to manufacturing limitations. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate the influence of core geometry on the compliance and confirm the ability of chiral-core airfoils to sustain large deflections while not exceeding yield strain limits.},

  abstract = {Periodic cellular configurations with negative Poisson's ratio have attracted the attention of several researchers because of their superior dynamic characteristics. Among the geometries with a negative Poisson's ratio, the chiral topology features localized deformed configurations when excited at one of its natural frequencies. This is of particular importance as resonance can be exploited to minimize the power required for the appearance of localized deformations, thus giving practicality to the concept. The particular nature of these deformed configurations and the authority provided by the chiral geometry suggest the application of the proposed structural configuration for the design of innovative lifting devices, such as helicopter rotor blades or airplane wings. The dynamic characteristics of chiral structures are here investigated through a numerical model and experimental investigations. The numerical formulation uses dynamic shape functions to accurately describe the behavior of the considered structural assembly over a wide frequency range. The model is used to predict frequency response functions, and to investigate the occurrence of localized deformations. Experimental tests are also performed to demonstrate the accuracy of the model and to illustrate the peculiarities of the behavior of the considered chiral structures. 10.1177/1045389X06060219},

  abstract = {The paper presents a design study for a morphing structural concept, which could be used to obtain a passively actuated high-lift wing configuration. A composite chiral honeycomb core is used to allow large variations of camber at limited strain levels in the structure of the aerodynamic surface. The design hypothesis is first assessed by means of structural analyses, which are performed applying two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite elements schemes. The results confirm the morphing capabilities in the chordwise direction of the structure, which still retains noteworthy axial and torsional stiffness properties. The aeroelastic performances of the morphing airfoil are then optimized, taking into account aeroelastic stability as well as strength constraints. The optimal parameters of chiral network and the required stiffness properties of the covering skin are identified. Overall, the work confirms the promising performances of morphing structures based on chiral topologies and assesses a numerical approach for the design of morphing aerodynamic structures.

Increasing interest in the design of smart devices and mechanical systems has identified buckling and postbuckling response as a favorable behavior.

Hexagonal chiral honeycombs are cellular structures composed noncentresymmetric unit cells, with an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) with a value of -1. Cylinders connected by tangent ligaments at 60?? degrees compose the unit cells. Approximated analytical models are proposed for the purpose of initial design assuming the main contribution to the elastic collapse stress being given by the nodes, and considering also the superposition of the critical elastic loads of each component of the unit cell. The models are expressed in terms of nondimensional geometric unit cell parameters (ligament to cylinder radius aspect ratio and relative density), and core material properties. Finite element calculations using shell and brick elements are also performed on unit cell models with periodic boundary conditions using linear bifurcation buckling analysis. The analytical and numerical results are compared with the outcome of a series of experimental flatwise compressive tests carried out on chiral honeycomb samples manufactured using rapid prototyping technique in PA sintered powder and ABS plastics. The comparison shows good convergence between the sets of results, and highlights the specific deformation mechanisms of the hexagonal chiral honeycomb cell. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The considered layout has a hexagonal chiral geometry featuring cylinders, or nodes, joined by ligaments, or ribs. The resulting assembly is characterized by a number of interesting properties that can be exploited for the design of alternative honeycombs or cellular topologies to be used in sandwich construction. The flat-wise strength of the chiral geometry is investigated through classical analytical formulas for the linear buckling of thin plates and shells and a bifurcation analysis performed on a Finite Element model. The analytical expressions predict the global buckling behavior and the resulting critical loads, and can be directly compared with the results obtained from the Finite Element analysis. In addition, the Finite Element model predicts local buckling modes, which should be considered to evaluate the possible development of localized plasticity. A sensitivity study is performed to evaluate the influence of the geometry of the chiral structure on its buckling strength. The study shows that the considered topology can offer great design flexibility, whereby several parameters can be selected and modified to improve the flat-wise performance. The comparison with traditional, hexagonal centro-symmetric structural configurations concludes the paper and demonstrates the enhanced performance and the potentials of chiral noncentro-symmetric designs.},

The magnitude of the buckling stress depends strongly on the density of the honeycomb and weakly on the shape of the unit hexagonal cell. On the other hand, the shape of the collapse surface depends strongly on the cell geometry and may be thought of as independent of the density of the honeycomb.

We focus on tailoring the bending-twisting response to a spanwise loading of thin-walled rectangular composite beam structures by intentionally inducing elastic instabilities. For this purpose, the component is designed with a particular material anisotropy utilising unidirectional fibre reinforced composites. Tailoring the fibre orientation and web thickness enables the onset of buckling to be triggered purely passively at a prescribed level of external loading. We utilise the modified load-structure interaction resulting from the deliberate occurrence of externally triggered elastic instabilities to achieve a desired buckling-induced sectional twist. Analytical and numerical models are developed to obtain bounds on the attainable stiffness and shape adaptability by exploiting purposely induced elastic instability. The accuracy and validity of the obtained predictions are confirmed with experimental results from composite beam demonstrators. The study demonstrates the possibility of creating functionality exploiting elastic instabilities, resulting in a novel passive shape adaptation mechanism for simple composite structures.},
