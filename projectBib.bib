  abstract = {Aircraft wings are a compromise that allows the aircraft to fly at$\backslash$na range of flight conditions, but the performance at each condition$\backslash$nis sub-optimal. The ability of a wing surface to change its geometry$\backslash$nduring flight has interested researchers and designers over the years$\backslash$nas this reduces the design compromises required. Morphing is the$\backslash$nshort form for metamorphose; however, there is neither an exact definition$\backslash$nnor an agreement between the researchers about the type or the extent$\backslash$nof the geometrical changes necessary to qualify an aircraft for the$\backslash$ntitle {\^{a}}€˜shape morphing.{\^{a}}€™ Geometrical parameters that can be affected$\backslash$nby morphing solutions can be categorized into: planform alteration$\backslash$n(span, sweep, and chord), out-of-plane transformation (twist, dihedral/gull,$\backslash$nand span-wise bending), and airfoil adjustment (camber and thickness).$\backslash$nChanging the wing shape or geometry is not new. Historically, morphing$\backslash$nsolutions always led to penalties in terms of cost, complexity, or$\backslash$nweight, although in certain circumstances, these were overcome by$\backslash$nsystem-level benefits. The current trend for highly efficient and$\backslash$n{\^{a}}€˜green{\^{a}}€™ aircraft makes such compromises less acceptable, calling$\backslash$nfor innovative morphing designs able to provide more benefits and$\backslash$nfewer drawbacks. Recent developments in {\^{a}}€˜smart{\^{a}}€™ materials may$\backslash$novercome the limitations and enhance the benefits from existing design$\backslash$nsolutions. The challenge is to design a structure that is capable$\backslash$nof withstanding the prescribed loads, but is also able to change$\backslash$nits shape: ideally, there should be no distinction between the structure$\backslash$nand the actuation system. The blending of morphing and smart structures$\backslash$nin an integrated approach requires multi-disciplinary thinking from$\backslash$nthe early development, which significantly increases the overall$\backslash$ncomplexity, even at the preliminary design stage. Morphing is a promising$\backslash$nenabling technology for the future, next-generation aircraft. However,$\backslash$nmanufacturers and end users are still too skeptical of the benefits$\backslash$nto adopt morphing in the near future. Many developed concepts have$\backslash$na technology readiness level that is still very low. The recent explosive$\backslash$ngrowth of satellite services means that UAVs are the technology of$\backslash$nchoice for many investigations on wing morphing. This article presents$\backslash$na review of the state-of-the-art on morphing aircraft and focuses$\backslash$non structural, shape-changing morphing concepts for both fixed and$\backslash$nrotary wings, with particular reference to active systems. Inflatable$\backslash$nsolutions have been not considered, and skin issues and challenges$\backslash$nare not discussed in detail. Although many interesting concepts have$\backslash$nbeen synthesized, few have progressed to wing tunnel testing, and$\backslash$neven fewer have flown. Furthermore, any successful wing morphing$\backslash$nsystem must overcome the weight penalty due to the additional actuation$\backslash$nsystems.},

  abstract = {In this paper a concept of hexagonal chiral honeycomb is proposed as a truss-like internal structure for adaptive wing box configurations. In contrast with classical centresym-metric cellular structures like rectangular or hexagonal grids, the proposed honeycomb did not present inversion symmetry, and featured an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio behaviour. The cellular structure considered exhibited this Poisson's ratio behaviour under a large range of strain. A set of numerical (finite element, FE) simulations have been carried out in order to correct the initial theoretical predictions to take into account axial, shear and elastic deformations of all elements composing the unit cell when subjected to uniaxial loading. The homogenized linear elastic mechanical properties were then introduced in an FE wing box model of a racecar wing coupled to a panel code to simulate unidirectional static fluid--structure coupling between the wing box and the flow surrounding the airfoil. The cellular solid proposed as the internal layout of the wing box allowed conforming deformations with the external flow, giving a variation of the camber line and trailing edge displacement, and acting as an aileron},

  abstract = {Poisson's ratio in materials is governed by the following aspects of the microstructure: the presence of rotational degrees of freedom, non-affine deformation kinematics, or anisotropic structure. Several structural models are examined. The non-affine kinematics are seen to be essential for the production of negative Poisson's ratios for isotropic materials containing central force linkages of positive stiffness. Non-central forces combined with pre-load can also give rise to a negative Poisson's ratio in isotropic materials. A chiral microstructure with non- central force interaction or non-affine deformation can also exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio. Toughness and damage resistance in these materials may be affected by the Poisson's ratio itself, as well as by generalized continuum aspects associated with the microstructure.},

Numerical analyses are performed to exploit such properties in the design of a morphing airfoil. The advantages associated with the use of composites are investigated by comparing the numerical results with those obtained with a metallic structure. A manufacturing process is then developed to assemble the considered structural configurations using composite materials. The novel process developed is described as applied to the manufacturing of macro chiral components that are tested to evaluate their ability to undergo large deformations. Finally, detailed numerical models of the manufactured structures are presented as a possible approach to evaluate the strength of the proposed configuration. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Spadoni2007b,
  abstract = {This paper presents an innovative wing profile featuring an internal truss-like structure of chiral topology. The chiral design is selected because of its unique deformation characteristics, which produce a theoretical, in-plane Poisson's ratio of -1. Such a Poisson's ratio yields a very high shear modulus, which in principle does not require the wing profile to be defined by a closed section or stressed-skin configuration. In addition, the peculiar deformation mechanism of the chiral configuration allows large decambering deflections to occur, with all the members of assembly behaving within the linear range of the material. Hence the proposed design combines large chordwise compliance and large in-plane shear stiffness. Such conflicting mechanical properties can be achieved through the proper selection of a limited number of geometric parameters defining the core configuration. The objective of the paper is to investigate the compliance characteristics of the airfoil. Two-dimensional profiles, designed according to results from previous investigations, are manufactured and tested to assess compliance and evaluate decambering deflection limits. The experimental analysis is guided by numerical models that account for deviations from the ideal configuration due to manufacturing limitations. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate the influence of core geometry on the compliance and confirm the ability of chiral-core airfoils to sustain large deflections while not exceeding yield strain limits.},

  abstract = {Periodic cellular configurations with negative Poisson's ratio have attracted the attention of several researchers because of their superior dynamic characteristics. Among the geometries with a negative Poisson's ratio, the chiral topology features localized deformed configurations when excited at one of its natural frequencies. This is of particular importance as resonance can be exploited to minimize the power required for the appearance of localized deformations, thus giving practicality to the concept. The particular nature of these deformed configurations and the authority provided by the chiral geometry suggest the application of the proposed structural configuration for the design of innovative lifting devices, such as helicopter rotor blades or airplane wings. The dynamic characteristics of chiral structures are here investigated through a numerical model and experimental investigations. The numerical formulation uses dynamic shape functions to accurately describe the behavior of the considered structural assembly over a wide frequency range. The model is used to predict frequency response functions, and to investigate the occurrence of localized deformations. Experimental tests are also performed to demonstrate the accuracy of the model and to illustrate the peculiarities of the behavior of the considered chiral structures. 10.1177/1045389X06060219},
