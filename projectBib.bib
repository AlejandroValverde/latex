abstract = {Aircraft wings are a compromise that allows the aircraft to fly at$\backslash$na range of flight conditions, but the performance at each condition$\backslash$nis sub-optimal. The ability of a wing surface to change its geometry$\backslash$nduring flight has interested researchers and designers over the years$\backslash$nas this reduces the design compromises required. Morphing is the$\backslash$nshort form for metamorphose; however, there is neither an exact definition$\backslash$nnor an agreement between the researchers about the type or the extent$\backslash$nof the geometrical changes necessary to qualify an aircraft for the$\backslash$ntitle {\^{a}}€˜shape morphing.{\^{a}}€™ Geometrical parameters that can be affected$\backslash$nby morphing solutions can be categorized into: planform alteration$\backslash$n(span, sweep, and chord), out-of-plane transformation (twist, dihedral/gull,$\backslash$nand span-wise bending), and airfoil adjustment (camber and thickness).$\backslash$nChanging the wing shape or geometry is not new. Historically, morphing$\backslash$nsolutions always led to penalties in terms of cost, complexity, or$\backslash$nweight, although in certain circumstances, these were overcome by$\backslash$nsystem-level benefits. The current trend for highly efficient and$\backslash$n{\^{a}}€˜green{\^{a}}€™ aircraft makes such compromises less acceptable, calling$\backslash$nfor innovative morphing designs able to provide more benefits and$\backslash$nfewer drawbacks. Recent developments in {\^{a}}€˜smart{\^{a}}€™ materials may$\backslash$novercome the limitations and enhance the benefits from existing design$\backslash$nsolutions. The challenge is to design a structure that is capable$\backslash$nof withstanding the prescribed loads, but is also able to change$\backslash$nits shape: ideally, there should be no distinction between the structure$\backslash$nand the actuation system. The blending of morphing and smart structures$\backslash$nin an integrated approach requires multi-disciplinary thinking from$\backslash$nthe early development, which significantly increases the overall$\backslash$ncomplexity, even at the preliminary design stage. Morphing is a promising$\backslash$nenabling technology for the future, next-generation aircraft. However,$\backslash$nmanufacturers and end users are still too skeptical of the benefits$\backslash$nto adopt morphing in the near future. Many developed concepts have$\backslash$na technology readiness level that is still very low. The recent explosive$\backslash$ngrowth of satellite services means that UAVs are the technology of$\backslash$nchoice for many investigations on wing morphing. This article presents$\backslash$na review of the state-of-the-art on morphing aircraft and focuses$\backslash$non structural, shape-changing morphing concepts for both fixed and$\backslash$nrotary wings, with particular reference to active systems. Inflatable$\backslash$nsolutions have been not considered, and skin issues and challenges$\backslash$nare not discussed in detail. Although many interesting concepts have$\backslash$nbeen synthesized, few have progressed to wing tunnel testing, and$\backslash$neven fewer have flown. Furthermore, any successful wing morphing$\backslash$nsystem must overcome the weight penalty due to the additional actuation$\backslash$nsystems.},
