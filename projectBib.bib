abstract = {Semi-active structural elements based on variable stiffness represent a promising approach to the solution of the conflict of requirements between load-carrying capability and shape adaptivity in morphing lightweight structures. In the present work, a structural concept with adaptive bending--twist coupling aiming at a broad adjustment range of coupling stiffness while maintaining high flexural rigidity is investigated by analysis, simulation and experiment.},
