%Torsional stiffness

\begin{equation}\label{eq:torStiff}
  G I_t = \frac{4 A_0^2}{\oint \frac{\mathrm{d} s}{G(s) t(s)}}
\end{equation}

%Equations for the static moment and the flexural stiffness along the $y$ axis $\Phi_y$ (3.17, 3.18, 3.19)

%Equations for the shear flow calculation (3.20, 3.21)

%Shear centre expressions (3.22)

%The shear force is moved to the shear centre, causing an additional torsional moment given by Equation \ref{eq:momentDueToQz}. This produces a constant shear flow $q_M$ that is calculated as shown in Equation \ref{eq:constantShearFlow}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:momentDueToQz}
  M_\mathrm{t} = Q_\mathrm{z} (y_{\mathrm{Q}} - y_\mathrm{SC})
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:constantShearFlow}
  q_M = \frac{M_\mathrm{t}}{2 A_0}
\end{equation}
%
where it has been taken into a account that a positive moment along the $x$ axis produces a constant shear flow distribution which has opposite sign as the shear flow distribution defined positive.

Finally, the total shear flow is given by the Expression \ref{eq:totalShearFlow}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:totalShearFlow}
  q(s) = q_\mathrm{C}(s) - q_\mathrm{M}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Parametric study} \label{subsec:parametricStudy} %Reference for this part -> \cite{Raither_basic}

In the present subsection, the variation of the beam properties for different parameter values will be shown. The beam geometry will be characterized through the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$, the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ and the slenderness ratio $L/B$. The effect of these parameters on the sectional properties, twist and bending stiffness, and flexural and twisting compliance will be shown. Additionally, the variance of the stiffness ratio $E_1/E_2$ will also be included in the analysis.

\subsubsection{Results} \label{subsubsec:results_parametricStudy}

The influence of the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$ on the torsional stiffness $G I_t$, the shear centre position $y_{\mathrm{SC}}$ and the flexural stiffness $E I_y$ is shown in Figures \ref{fig:GIt-E1overE2-BoverH}, \ref{fig:SC-E1overE2-BoverH} and \ref{fig:EIy-E1overE2-BoverH}, respectively. On its side, the effect of thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ on the same three beam parameters is shown in Figures \ref{fig:GIt-E1overE2-t2overt1}, \ref{fig:SC-E1overE2-t2overt1} and \ref{fig:EIy-E1overE2-t2overt1}.

Additionally, the effect of the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$ on the deflection and torsional compliance is shown on Figures \ref{fig:woverQ-E1overE2-BoverH} and \ref{fig:phioverQ-E1overE2-BoverH}, respectively. The corresponding plots when analysing the effect of the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ on the deflection and torsional compliance are shown on Figures \ref{fig:woverQ-E1overE2-t2overt1} and \ref{fig:phioverQ-E1overE2-t2overt1}, respectively. The beam's torsional compliance will be expressed as fraction of the twist at the tip divided by the vertical force applied, that is $|\phi_{\mathrm{tip}}| / Q$, while the beam deflection compliance will be expressed as fraction of the maximum vertical displacement at the tip divided by the vertical force applied, that is $w_{\mathrm{0,tip}} / Q$.

The effect of the slenderness ratio $L/B$ on the deflection and torsional compliances is shown in Figures \ref{fig:woverQ-E1overE2-LoverB} and \ref{fig:phioverQ-E1overE2-LoverB}, respectively.

\subsubsection{Discussion of the results} \label{subsubsec:disc_results_parametricStudy}

The maximum torsional stiffness $G I_t$ as a function on the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$ can be visualized in Figure \ref{fig:GIt-E1overE2-BoverH}. It can be seen that it appears for $B/H = 1$ when $E_1/E_2 = 1$. Therefore, as it is also shown in \cite{Raither_basic}, the closer the torsional stiffness to the doubly symmetric case, the higher its torsional stiffness. However, when $E_1/E_2 > 10$, the maximum torsional stiffness is shown to appear for $B/H > 1$. A similar conclusion can be extract when analysing the Figure \ref{fig:GIt-E1overE2-t2overt1}, that shows the influence of the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ on the torsional stiffness $G I_t$.

In Figure \ref{fig:SC-E1overE2-BoverH} it can be seen that for values $E_2 \ll E_1$, the shear centre position $y_{\mathrm{SC}}$ is approximately constant for $B/H$ variations. In this context, the beam approximates its behavior as if it has an open profile section. However, as the value of $E_1/E_2$ decreases, the influence of the ratio $B/H$ increases showing a bigger influence of the web where the Young's modulus $E_2$ applies. On the other hand, Figure \ref{fig:SC-E1overE2-t2overt1} shows that the bigger the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ is, the closer that the shear centre $y_{\mathrm{SC}}$ will be to the vertical axis of simmetry. However, for $E_2 \ll E_1$ the influence of the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ is reduced.

The influence of the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$ and the tickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ on the flexural stiffness $E I_y$ is shown to be bigger that that of the Young's modulus ratio $E_1/E_2$, as shown on Figures \ref{fig:EIy-E1overE2-BoverH} and \ref{fig:EIy-E1overE2-t2overt1}, respectively.

% The beam torsional compliance is highly dependant on that torsional moment applied on the beam, that depends on the shear centre $y_{\mathrm{SC}} position. Therefore, as shown on Figure \ref{fig:phioverQ-E1overE2-t2overt1}, the beam's torsional compliance is approximately constant for values of thickness ratio $t_2/t_1 > 1$.
