\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro_Results_sim}

\section{Parametric study on the analytical model} \label{sec:analyticalParametricStudy_Results_sim} 
In the present subsection, the variation of the beam properties for different parameter values will be shown. The beam geometry will be characterized through the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$, the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ and the slenderness ratio $L/B$. The effect of these parameters on the sectional properties, twist and bending stiffness, and flexural and twisting compliance will be shown. Additionally, the variance of the stiffness ratio $E_1/E_2$ will also be included in the analysis.

\subsection{Results} \label{subsec:results_parametricStudy}

The influence of the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$ on the torsional stiffness $G I_t$, the shear centre position $y_{\mathrm{SC}}$ and the flexural stiffness $E I_y$ is shown in Figures \ref{fig:GIt-E1overE2-BoverH}, \ref{fig:SC-E1overE2-BoverH} and \ref{fig:EIy-E1overE2-BoverH}, respectively. On its side, the effect of thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ on the same three beam parameters is shown in Figures \ref{fig:GIt-E1overE2-t2overt1}, \ref{fig:SC-E1overE2-t2overt1} and \ref{fig:EIy-E1overE2-t2overt1}.

Additionally, the effect of the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$ on the deflection and torsional compliance is shown on Figures \ref{fig:woverQ-E1overE2-BoverH} and \ref{fig:phioverQ-E1overE2-BoverH}, respectively. The corresponding plots when analysing the effect of the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ on the deflection and torsional compliance are shown on Figures \ref{fig:woverQ-E1overE2-t2overt1} and \ref{fig:phioverQ-E1overE2-t2overt1}, respectively. The beam's torsional compliance will be expressed as fraction of the twist at the tip divided by the vertical force applied, that is $|\phi_{\mathrm{tip}}| / Q$, while the beam deflection compliance will be expressed as fraction of the maximum vertical displacement at the tip divided by the vertical force applied, that is $w_{\mathrm{0,tip}} / Q$.

The effect of the slenderness ratio $L/B$ on the deflection and torsional compliances is shown in Figures \ref{fig:woverQ-E1overE2-LoverB} and \ref{fig:phioverQ-E1overE2-LoverB}, respectively.

\subsection{Discussion of the results} \label{ubsec:disc_results_parametricStudy}

The maximum torsional stiffness $G I_t$ as a function on the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$ can be visualized in Figure \ref{fig:GIt-E1overE2-BoverH}. It can be seen that it appears for $B/H = 1$ when $E_1/E_2 = 1$. Therefore, as it is also shown in \cite{Raither2013a}, the closer the torsional stiffness to the doubly symmetric case, the higher its torsional stiffness. However, when $E_1/E_2 > 10$, the maximum torsional stiffness is shown to appear for $B/H > 1$. A similar conclusion can be extract when analysing the Figure \ref{fig:GIt-E1overE2-t2overt1}, that shows the influence of the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ on the torsional stiffness $G I_t$.

In Figure \ref{fig:SC-E1overE2-BoverH} it can be seen that for values $E_2 \ll E_1$, the shear centre position $y_{\mathrm{SC}}$ is approximately constant for $B/H$ variations. In this context, the beam approximates its behavior as if it has an open profile section. However, as the value of $E_1/E_2$ decreases, the influence of the ratio $B/H$ increases showing a bigger influence of the web where the Young's modulus $E_2$ applies. On the other hand, Figure \ref{fig:SC-E1overE2-t2overt1} shows that the bigger the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ is, the closer that the shear centre $y_{\mathrm{SC}}$ will be to the vertical axis of simmetry. However, for $E_2 \ll E_1$ the influence of the thickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ is reduced.

The influence of the cross-sectional aspect ratio $B/H$ and the tickness ratio $t_2/t_1$ on the flexural stiffness $E I_y$ is shown to be bigger that that of the Young's modulus ratio $E_1/E_2$, as shown on Figures \ref{fig:EIy-E1overE2-BoverH} and \ref{fig:EIy-E1overE2-t2overt1}, respectively.

% The beam torsional compliance is highly dependant on that torsional moment applied on the beam, that depends on the shear centre $y_{\mathrm{SC}} position. Therefore, as shown on Figure \ref{fig:phioverQ-E1overE2-t2overt1}, the beam's torsional compliance is approximately constant for values of thickness ratio $t_2/t_1 > 1$.

\section{Connection between the chiral lattice and the wing-box skin} \label{sec:connection_results_model}

Two different approaches were followed to model the rigid body behavior of the lattice nodes, as shown in Section \ref{subsec:parametrization_Model}.

The modeling of the lattice nodes through either the coupling through a reference point and through tyre was shown to 

\section{Mesh} \label{sec:mesh_results_model}

The model was build using cell shell elements as the fundamental constituting part. The thickness is assigned in the perpendicular direction, as it was shown in Figure \ref{fig:shellElement}.

This type of element is a 2D element that it was used to build 3D structures. This kind of procedure may incur some distortion in the mesh elements due to shell elements intersecting in the same line at different angles. 

For the designed model, this situation occurred at the chiral lattice at certain points. As soon in Figure \ref{fig:meshDistorted} it can be seen that the distorted elements appear at mainly at two different positions. Firstly, at the plane where the two ligaments with different curvature join. At this point, the sharp angles that appear in between the part geometrical lines induce the appearance of tetrahedral distorted mesh elements. The second typical location for appearance of distorted elements is along the curve where the lattice nodes and the curved ligaments join.

  \caption[Distorted mesh elements in the model]{Distorted mesh elements in the model. The number of distorted elements was found to be crucial for the simulation convergence.}\label{fig:meshDistorted}
\end{figure}

It was seen that the number of distorted elements had a significant effect in the simulation convergence. For a high number of distorted elements, the simulation could not go further from the first step. No attempts to locally modify the mesh at the mentioned locations were made, instead, it was found that modifying the global mesh size gave enough control over the number of distorted elements to be able to overcome this limitation. The bigger the mesh size in the area, the less distorted elements appear after completing the meshing operations.
