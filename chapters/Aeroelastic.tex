\chapter{Aeroelastic study} \label{chap:aeroelastic}

  %Intro
  In the present chapter, the compliant design for the wing-box is embedded into a full wing model. A pressure field is then introduced to simulated the pressure distribution obtained from the evaluation of the aerodynamic forces around the airfoil.

  \section{Wing model} \label{sec:wingModel_aeroelastic}

    The wing is modeled in its half span dimension and the airfoil is one symmetric NACA 0012. An overview of the wing model can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:wing}.

    The boundary condition for the wing-box includes establish a free condition at the tip of the wing and a clamping condition at the root.

    %Introduce airfoil parameters, such as chord and so on

  \section{Aerodynamic model} \label{sec:aerodynamic_aeroelastic}

    The pressure distribution originated from the fluid-airfoil interaction is responsible of the forces applied into the wing model. This is the only source of forces introduced into the model. The pressure distribution is obtained using \copyright XFOIL software which considers the airfoil geometry and the flight condition.

    The flight condition is determined by introducing the air velocity $V$, the air density $\rho$, the air dynamic viscosity $\mu$
