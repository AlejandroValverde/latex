\section{Morphing aircraft} \label{sec:Morphing_state}

  The interest in morphing of the aerodynamic surfaces has accompany aerospace history since the beginning. Since the first heavier-than-air flight in 1903, when the Wright Brothers designed and build the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered heavier-than-air aircraft. Their concept of aircraft did not provide importance to built-in stability but absolute control of the aircraft by the pilot. For this reason, they deliberatively designed their first aircraft with anhedral wing that make it be dynamically unstable to perturbations in sideslip but more maneuverable in the lateral direction. In order to achieve roll control, they decided to incorporate a mechanism that would allow the wings to twist by pulling from cables, as it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:Wright}. This was the first ever use of morphing of an aerodynamic surface for aircraft control. Since them, the necessity of enhanced performance and higher airspeed brought the requirement of stiffer wing structures to avoid aeroelastic instabilities. This caused the invention o

  %Why to used them?
  On conventional aircraft, the need to modify the airflow around the airfoil at different flight conditions is achieve through discrete hinged mechanics such as flaps and ailerons. This mechanism perform well in a limited range around the design point while the outside this range, they have a negative influence in the aerodynamics. The necessary discontinuities in the surface bring forward the boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent regime. Being able to modify the airflow without discontinuities on the airfoil skin would come along with notable reduction in fuel consumption.

  %Why now?
  New interest has raised in the recent years in aircraft morphing, mainly due to the appearance of new smart materials that allow more efficient mechanical design that do not necessarily incur weight increase \cite{Lloyd2007}. Another reason that is pushing forward new aircraft morphing technologies is that missions today are in need of higher aircraft versatility to decrease operational costs in the commercial aviation field and aim smaller and more distributed targets in the military field. For example, Airbus has recently patented a design of a downwardly foldable wing tip device applicable for a large passenger aircraft \cite{Boye2015}.

  %Different morphing projects - \cite{Barbarino}
  A general classification of different wing morphing concepts can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:morphingTypes}: planform modification through variation of sweep angle, span or chord; out-of-plane alteration involving twist, dihedral angle and spanwise bending, and airfoil adjustment achieved by modifications of the airfoil chamber and/or thickness. Under this classification, the morphing technology that is the focus of this project is located under the out-of-plane branch and twist modification.

  %Fundamental idea
  Morphing designs may also benefit from geo-metrically flexible structures if the aeroelastic energy from the airstream can be used to activate the shape changing and tabs can maintain the shape using aero-elastic control.

  As mentioned before, it is the interest of this work to exploit the capabilities of materials with negative Poisson's ratio. Such materials expand laterally when stretched and contract laterally when compressed. In \cite{Lakes1991}, R. Lakes proposed that negative Poisson's ratios can result from a hexagonal microstructure of rotable nodes and bendable ligaments such as the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:chiral}. Such structures are known as non-centrosymmetric, hemitropic, or chiral; they are distinguishable from their mirror image; that is, they cannot be superposed onto them and they are not isotropic.

  In \cite{Prall1997}, experimental results showed that the a honeycomb chiral structure exhibited a Poisson's ratio of -1 for deformations in-plane. Indeed, this behavior was maintained over a significant range of strain, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:experimentalPoisson}, and therefore verifying that Poisson's ratio is independent upon the strain, in agreement with theory.

  The negative Poissonâ€™s ratio behavior leads to unique deformation patterns, and corresponds to a very high in-plane shear modulus $G$, as shown in Equation \ref{eq:shearModulus} for values of $\vu \to -1$.

\section{Chiral wing rib} \label{sec:wingRibChiral_state}

  Different approaches has been followed to exploit the particular characteristics of chiral structures on aerodynamic elements such as airfoils. In \cite{Bornengo2005} a truss-core configuration such as the one shown on the upper sketch of Figure \ref{fig:truss-core-airfoil} with chiral topology was utilized to design an airfoil for automotive competitions. The concept exploit the elastic deformation of the chiral lattice to modify the airfoil mean chamber line and thus modifying the pressure distribution as required for the current desired performance of the car. In \cite{Spadoni2007a}, a similar configuration was investigated by weakly coupled structural and CFD models, and the local and global deformations were characterized by consideration of the macroscopic chiral configuration. A prototype of the proposed design such as the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:truss-core-prototype} was manufactured and tested in \cite{Spadoni2007b}. Results showed a remarkable tailoring of the chamber morphing performance by means of a limited number of parameters which define the core geometry. The dynamic properties of such chiral truss-core assemblies were investigated in \cite{Spadoni2006}.
