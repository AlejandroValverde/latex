This sample document illustrates how to use \LaTeX\ to write a
Cranfield University thesis.  The files can be adapted for any
thesis type and follow the Prescribed Form for the Presentation of
Theses.  The file is based on Cedric Seynat's PhD thesis and
includes examples of some basic formatting methods (lists,
(sub)sections, figures and tables).

A normal thesis abstract should cover the following points: (1)
background to the project, (2) the project's objectives, (3) a
description of the methodology used, (4) the main findings, and
(5) the project's conclusions.
