% PhD thesis LaTeX file developed by Steve Hobbs based on that used by Cedric Seynat for a Cranfield University thesis.

% The actual thesis text is mostly contained in several separate .tex files (one per
% chapter typically) which are included when needed.  Most of the \include{...}
% commands are commented out here and during writing.

% The sample chapters introduction.tex and appendixB.tex are available and are used for illustration here.

% The following files are also used:
%       cover&title.tex
%       abstract&acknowledgements.tex
%       acronyms.tex
%       biblio.bib

% STATUS OF THIS FILE

% 13.00, 10 Apr 2006    Added Cranfield University logo to the front title page and spaces after most occurrences of "LaTeX".
%                       The comments have been updated to reflect the current example usage of include files.

% 18:09, 10 July 2005   Minor changes to ensure page heading for Reference section is References and not Bibliography and
%                       that the page numbers for the lists of tables and figures are for the start of these lists and
%                       not the end.

% 10:31, 11,19 Jan 2005 coverandtitle.tex, abstract&acknowledgements.tex, introduction.tex and biblio.bib now complete
%                       (all text, no CU logo yet on cover page).

% 10:06, 23 Aug 2004    The title pages have not yet been formatted, but the files all process without errors.
