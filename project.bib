In the present work, a structural concept with adaptive bending--twist coupling aiming at a broad adjustment range of coupling stiffness while maintaining high flexural rigidity is investigated by analysis, simulation and experiment.},

abstract = {A novel semi-passive morphing airfoil concept based on variable bending--twist coupling induced by adaptive shear center location and torsional stiffness is presented. Numerical parametric studies and upscaling show that the concept relying on smart materials permits effective twist control while offering the potential of being lightweight and energy efficient. By means of an experimental characterization of an adaptive beam and a scaled adaptive wing structure, effectiveness and producibility of the structural concept are demonstrated.},

- T = 0.62{\%} for 30m/s
- Wall corrections

Very important, conclusions:
- If the wing can modify its angle of attack independently of the rest of the body, then the vehicle can be flown at the ideal angle of attack, minimizing the total drag

- Conformal shape changes do not penalize the drag of the wing,
and theymostly result in a movement of the operating point along the drag polar of the unactuated profile.},

@article{Bornengo2005,
abstract = {In this paper a concept of hexagonal chiral honeycomb is proposed as a truss-like internal structure for adaptive wing box configurations. In contrast with classical centresym-metric cellular structures like rectangular or hexagonal grids, the proposed honeycomb did not present inversion symmetry, and featured an in-plane negative Poisson's ratio behaviour. The cellular structure considered exhibited this Poisson's ratio behaviour under a large range of strain. A set of numerical (finite element, FE) simulations have been carried out in order to correct the initial theoretical predictions to take into account axial, shear and elastic deformations of all elements composing the unit cell when subjected to uniaxial loading. The homogenized linear elastic mechanical properties were then introduced in an FE wing box model of a racecar wing coupled to a panel code to simulate unidirectional static fluid--structure coupling between the wing box and the flow surrounding the airfoil. The cellular solid proposed as the internal layout of the wing box allowed conforming deformations with the external flow, giving a variation of the camber line and trailing edge displacement, and acting as an aileron},
